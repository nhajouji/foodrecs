This allows to assign a score to each recipe that indicates how similar the recipe is to other recipes that user has interacted with.\n",
    "3) We convert the string $s$ (first part of 2) to a vector using a sentence transformer. This allows us to assign a score to each recipe based on how similar it is to the query.\n",
