# How to Launch this App
* Make sure you have the following installed:
    * FastAPI
    * Uvicorn
* Open your terminal (or CMD in Windows) then...
    * CD into the App Folder: cd App
    * Type the following: uvicorn main:app --reload
    * Wait for the server to launch, then go to your local host address in your browser. 

Note: The "--reload" part above isn't necessary to run the server locally. This extra part will make your local server restart every time you save a change in the code.
